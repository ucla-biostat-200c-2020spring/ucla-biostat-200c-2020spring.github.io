## Additive models

- For $p$ predictors $x_1, \ldots, x_p$, nonparametric regression takes the form
$$
y = f(x_1, \ldots, x_p) + \epsilon.
$$
For $p$ larger than two or three, it becomes impractical to fit such models due to large sample size requirements. 

- A simplified model is the **additive model**
$$
y = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p f_j(x_j) + \epsilon,
$$
where $f_j$ are smooth functions. Interaction terms are ignored. To incorporate categorical predictors, we can use the model
$$
y = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p f_j(x_j) + \mathbf{z}^T \boldsymbol{\gamma} + \epsilon,
$$
where $\mathbf{z}$ are categorical predictors.

- There are several packages in R that can fit additive models: `gam`, `mgcv` (included in default installation of R), and `gss`.

- `gam` package uses a **backfitting algorithm** for fitting the additive models.

    1. Initialize $\beta_0 = \bar y$, $f_j(x_j) = \hat \beta_j x_j$ say from the least squares fit.  
    
    2. Cycle throught $j=1,\ldots,p, 1,\ldots,p,\ldots$
    $$
    f_j = S(x_j, y - \beta_0 - \sum_{i \ne j} f_i(X_i)),
    $$
    where $S(x,y)$ means the smooth on the data $(x, y)$. User specifies the smoother being used. 
    
    The algorithm is iterated until convergence. 

- `mgcv` package employs a penalized smoothing spline approach. Suppose
$$
f_j(x) = \sum_i \beta_i \phi_i(x)
$$
for a family of spline basis functions, $\phi_i$. The roughness penalty $\int [f_j''(x)]^2 \, dx$ translates to the term $\boldsymbol{\beta}_j^T \mathbf{S}_j \boldsymbol{\beta}_j$ for a suitable $\mathbf{S}_j$ that depends on the choice of basis. It then maximizes the penalized log-likelihood
$$
\log L(\boldsymbol{\beta}) - \sum_j \lambda_j \boldsymbol{\beta}_j^T \mathbf{S}_j \boldsymbol{\beta}_j,
$$
where $\lambda_j$ control the amount of smoothing for each variable. Generalized cross-validation (GCV) is used to select the $\lambda_j$s. 

    
## LA ozone concentration

- The response is `O3` (ozone level). The predictors are `temp` (temperature at El Monte), `ibh` (inversion base height at LAX), and `ibt` (inversion top temperature at LAX). 
```{r}
ozone <- as_tibble(ozone) %>% print()
```    

- Numerical summary.
```{r}
summary(ozone)
```

- Graphical summary. 
```{r}
ozone %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = temp, y = O3)) + 
  geom_point(size = 1) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
ozone %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ibh, y = O3)) + 
  geom_point(size = 1) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

```{r}
ozone %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ibt, y = O3)) + 
  geom_point(size = 1) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

- As a reference, let's fit a linear model
```{r}
olm <- lm(O3 ~ temp + ibh + ibt, data = ozone)
summary(olm)
```


<!-- - Effects of predictors.  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- library(effects) -->
<!-- plot(Effect("temp", olm, partial.residuals = TRUE)) -->
<!-- plot(Effect("ibh",  olm, partial.residuals = TRUE)) -->
<!-- plot(Effect("ibt",  olm, partial.residuals = TRUE)) -->
<!-- ``` -->

- Additive model using `mgcv`.

```{r}
library(mgcv)

ammgcv <- gam(O3 ~ s(temp) + s(ibh) + s(ibt), data = ozone)
summary(ammgcv)
```
Effective degrees of freedom is calculated as the trace of projection matrices. An approximate F test gives the significance of predictors.


- We can exmine the transformations being used.

```{r}
plot(ammgcv, residuals = TRUE, select = 1)
plot(ammgcv, residuals = TRUE, select = 2)
plot(ammgcv, residuals = TRUE, select = 3)
```

- `ibt` is not significant after adjusting for the effects of `temp` and `ibh`, so we drop it in following analysis.

- We can test the significance of the nonlinearity of a predictor by F test.

```{r}
am1 <- gam(O3 ~ s(temp) + s(ibh), data = ozone)
am2 <- gam(O3 ~    temp + s(ibh), data = ozone)
anova(am2, am1, test = "F")
```

- We can include functions of two variables with `mgcv` to incorporate interactions. In the *isotropic* case (same scale), we can impose same smoothing on both variables. In the *anisotropic* case (different scales), we use tensor product to allow different smoothings.

```{r}
# te(x1, x2) play the role x1 * x2 in regular lm/glm
amint <- gam(O3 ~ te(temp, ibh), data = ozone)
summary(amint)
```

- We can test the significance of the interactions using F test.

```{r}
anova(am1, amint, test = "F")
```

- We can visualize the interactions

```{r}
plot(amint, select = 1)
vis.gam(amint, theta = -45, color = "gray")
```

- GAM can be used for prediction.

```{r}
predict(am1, data.frame(temp = 60, ibh = 2000, ibt = 100), se = T)
```
```{r}
# extrapolation
predict(am1, data.frame(temp = 120, ibh = 2000, ibt = 100), se = T)
```

### Generalized additive model

- Combining GLM and additive model yields the **generalized additive models (GAMs)**. The systematic component (linear predictor) becomes
$$
\eta = \beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p f_j(X_j).
$$

- For example, we an fit the `ozone` data using a Poisson additive model. Setting `scale = -1` tells the function to fit overdispersion parameter as well. 

```{r}
gammgcv <- gam(O3 ~ s(temp) + s(ibh) + s(ibt), family = poisson, scale = -1, data = ozone)
summary(gammgcv)
```

```{r}
plot(gammgcv, residuals = TRUE, select = 1)
plot(gammgcv, residuals = TRUE, select = 2)
plot(gammgcv, residuals = TRUE, select = 3)
```

## Generalized additive mixed model (GAMM)

- GAMM combine the three major themes in this class. 

- Let's re-analyze the `eplepsy` data from the GLMM chapter. 

```{r}
egamm <- gamm(seizures ~ offset(timeadj) + treat * expind + s(age), 
              family   = poisson, 
              random   = list(id = ~1), 
              data     = epilepsy,  
              subset   = (id != 49))
summary(egamm$gam)
```

## Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)

- MARS fits data by model
$$
\hat f(x) = \sum_{j=1}^k c_j B_j(x),
$$
where the basis functions $B_j(x)$ are formed from products of terms $[\pm (x_i - t)]_+^q$. 

- By default, only additive (first-order) predictors are allowed. 

```{r}
library(earth)

mmod <- earth(O3 ~ ., data = ozone)
summary(mmod)
```

- We can restrict the model size
```{r}
mmod <- earth(O3 ~ ., ozone, nk = 7)
summary(mmod)
```

- We can also include second-order (two-way) interaction term. Compare with the additive model approach. There are 9 predictors with 36 possible two-way interaction terms, which is complex to estimate and interpret. 

```{r}
mmod <- earth(O3 ~ ., ozone, nk = 7, degree = 2)
summary(mmod)
```

```{r}
plotmo(mmod)
```
